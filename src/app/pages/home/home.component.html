      <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take
        it further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you
        in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building
        data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.

      <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
      <p>
        Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the
        template language with your own components and use a wide array of
        existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback
        with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can
        focus on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.
