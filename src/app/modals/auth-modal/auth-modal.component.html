      <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take
        it further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you
        in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building
        data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.

      <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
      <p>
        Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the
        template language with your own components and use a wide array of
        existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback
        with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can
        focus on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.

      <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

      <p>
        Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the
        web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end
        to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development
        challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live
        on the web, mobile, or the desktop
